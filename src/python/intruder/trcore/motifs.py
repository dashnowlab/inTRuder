"""Comparison of tandem-repeat motifs, up to a configurable notion of sameness.

Three separate things can make two motif strings the same repeat, and they are
independent knobs because they are not equally safe:

*period reduction* (always on)
    ``CAGCAG`` is not a 6bp repeat, it is a 3bp one written twice, so every
    motif is first reduced to its primitive unit. This is arithmetic, not a
    judgement call, and there is no flag for it.

*rotation* (:attr:`MotifEquivalence.circular`, on by default)
    ``CAG``, ``AGC`` and ``GCA`` are one repeat read from different starting
    phases. TRF picks that phase arbitrarily, and both sides of the comparison
    are TRF output, so a phase difference is an artefact of the caller rather
    than biology.

*reverse complement* (:attr:`MotifEquivalence.reverse_complement`, OFF by default)
    ``CAG`` and ``CTG`` are the same double-stranded repeat read from opposite
    strands. Whether that makes them the same *locus feature* is a judgement
    call -- for a CAG expansion it usually does, but it also collapses the
    homopolymers ``A`` and ``T``, which is rarely what you want. Off unless
    asked for, and :attr:`MotifEquivalence.reverse_complement_bp` can restrict
    it to motifs long enough for an RC match to mean something.

Two motifs are equivalent when their canonical forms agree under the policy in
force. Everything looser than that lives in :class:`MotifTolerance`, which is a
separate object on purpose: *equivalence* decides how the catalogue is keyed and
is baked into the index, while *tolerance* is a per-query judgement about how far
off a reference motif may be and still explain the locus. Tolerance has three
settings, and :meth:`MotifTolerance.compare` reports which one fired:

``max_edits``
    A flat edit budget at every motif length. ``0`` (the default) means nothing
    fuzzy happens at all and ``CAG`` never matches ``CAT``.

``max_edit_fraction``
    An edit budget proportional to motif length, applied only above
    :data:`STR_MAX_MOTIF`. This is the VNTR knob: two catalogues almost never
    agree on a 47bp consensus, but they agree to within a few percent of its
    length, and a flat budget cannot say that without also letting short motifs
    match each other.

``min_subrepeat_motif``
    Also accept a reference motif that the query motif *tiles*, so a query of
    ``ACC`` can match a reference consensus of ``ACCATC``. TRF reports one
    representative unit per locus and picks its period arbitrarily, so the two
    sides can describe one repeat at different periods.

Nothing here knows about a particular repeat catalogue -- see
:mod:`novelty.platforms` for that -- and nothing here needs numpy, so a
pure-stdlib step can compare motifs without taking on pandas. The vectorised
wrapper for catalogue-scale data is :func:`novelty.platforms.canonical_motifs`.

    Period reduction (``CAGCAG`` -> ``CAG``) is not listed because it is always
    applied. The two that are listed differ in how safe they are, which is why
    they default differently:

    ``circular``
        Treat every rotation of the unit as the same repeat, so ``CAG``, ``AGC``
        and ``GCA`` agree. On by default -- TRF chooses the starting phase
        arbitrarily on both sides of the comparison.

    ``reverse_complement``
        Additionally treat the unit's reverse complement as the same repeat, so
        ``CAG`` and ``CTG`` agree. **Off by default**: it also merges the
        homopolymers ``A`` and ``T``, which loses a real distinction.

        Note that ``GC``/``CG`` and ``AT``/``TA`` are *not* examples of this --
        they are rotations of one another and collapse under ``circular``.

    ``reverse_complement_bp``
